# Home Assistant

## My Smart Home Philosophy

* Convenience 
  * My home should make smart decisions without me having to hit a button or say a command
* Control
  * Have simple voice activated or phone activated controls when the first principle is not possible


## Automation Ideas

### Smart Sleep Time
* home goes into sleep mode,
    * shuts off all lights, disabling appropriate motion sensors
    * locks all doors and reports on failure
    * sets state variable of sleep mode
* In the morning automatically wake up, 
    * enable motion sensors
    * turn off front door light
    * etc

### Unlock the front door
* When a trusted person is recognized, unlock the front door

### Party Time
* when the back yard disco ball is on, make the pool, landscape, and bar lights cycle color changes to compliment the disco ball
