# Home Assistant

## My Smart Home Philosophy

* Convenience 
  * My home should make smart decisions without me having to hit a button or say a command
* Control
  * Have simple voice activated or phone activated controls when the first principle is not possible


## Automation Ideas

### Smart Sleep Time
* home goes into sleep mode,
    * shuts off all lights, disabling appropriate motion sensors
    * locks all doors and reports on failure
    * sets state variable of sleep mode
* In the morning automatically wake up, 
    * enable motion sensors
    * turn off front door light
    * etc

### Unlock the front door
* When a trusted person is recognized, unlock the front door

### Party Time
* when the back yard disco ball is on, make the pool, landscape, and bar lights cycle color changes to compliment the disco ball

### Blind Control
* at a specified time lower blinds in the living room
    * also maybe adjust for if the TV gets turned on

### detect when we are not at home and put the home in Away Mode
* In away mode, lights come on at dark and go off and some time around 'Bedtime'

### Whole house power monitoring via Emporia

## Intergrations to add?
* presence detection; owntrack, gps logger, icloud platform 
* geolocation triggering
